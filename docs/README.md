### Chatbot for Clearing Basic Doubts About ASL:

Saradhi AI's integrated chatbot provides instant assistance and clears doubts about sign language. Powered by Intel-Hugging Face Neural Chat 7B model, the chatbot offers intelligent responses to user queries, ensuring a smooth learning experience. We have integrated the following three models for our chatbot feature: 
1. **Intel's NeuralChat 7B**
2. **OpenAI's GPT2 (Finetuned)**
3. **Google's Gemini Pro**

## Technologies Used!


- **Frontend**: Developed using **React Native** for a seamless mobile user interface. React Native is an open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities.

- **Backend**: Implemented with **FastAPI** to handle server-side logic efficiently.FastAPI is a modern web framework first released in 2018 for building RESTful APIs in Python. It is used for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python-type hints. FastAPI is based on Pydantic and uses type hints to validate, serialize and deserialize data. 

- **Sign Language Recognition**: The models used for Sign Language Recognition are all from Intel **OpenVino**, an open-source software toolkit for optimizing and deploying deep learning models. It enables programmers to develop scalable and efficient AI solutions with relatively few lines of code.  The models supported by the gesture recognition application are:
	1.  **asl-recognition-00040:** 
A human gesture recognition model for the American Sign Language (ASL) recognition scenario (word-level recognition). The model uses an S3D framework with MobileNet V3 backbone. Please refer to the  [MS-ASL-100](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ms-asl/)  dataset specification to see the list of gestures that are recognized by this model.The model accepts a stack of frames sampled with a constant frame rate (15 FPS) and produces a prediction on the input clip.
	
    
	2.  **common-sign-language-0001:**
			A human gesture recognition model for the Jester dataset recognition scenario (gesture-level recognition). The model uses an S3D framework with MobileNet V3 backbone. Please refer to the  [Jester](https://web.archive.org/web/20210722062232/https://20bn.com/datasets/jester/)  dataset specification to see the list of gestures that are recognized by this model. The model accepts a stack of frames (8 frames) sampled with a constant frame rate (15 FPS) and produces a prediction on the input clip.
		
    
	3. **common-sign-language-0002:**
	    A human gesture recognition model for the Common-Sign-Language gesture recognition scenario. The model support 12 common single-hand gestures:

		-   Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    
		-  	 Sliding Two Fingers Up / Down / Left / Right
    
		-   Thumb Up / Down
    
		The model uses an S3D framework with MobileNet V3 backbone and accepts a stack of frames (8 frames) sampled with a constant frame rate (15 FPS) and produces a prediction on the input clip.
    
	4.  **person-detection-asl-0001**:
This is a person detector for the ASL Recognition scenario. It is based on ShuffleNetV2-like backbone that includes depth-wise convolutions to reduce the amount of computation for the 3x3 convolution block and FCOS head.

- **Chatbot**: The two chatbots that are available and ready for use are **Gemini-pro from Google** and **NeuralChat 7B from Intel**. Apart from this many other chatbots have been tested such as Mistral, Zephyr, bert-large (**from intel's extension for transformers library**) and GPT-2. The chatbots hyper parameters have been tuned to be able to handle quries of different lengths related to sign language and can direct users to different sections of our app based on their queries.
- Along with this, we have finetuned OpenAI's **GPT2** using a custom dataset of 100 question-answer pairs. Kindly checkout our `finetune.py` notebook in the backend directory for more details.
